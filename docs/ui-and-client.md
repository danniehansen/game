# UI And Client Flow

`src/app.rs` wires the Bevy app. `src/app/ui` draws menus, worlds, HUD, pause, chat, confirmation, and multiplayer views.

Screens live in `MenuState`: `MainMenu`, `Worlds`, `Multiplayer`, `Options`, `InGame`. The multiplayer screen supports direct UDP connect through the same `ClientSession` runtime used by singleplayer.

Client resources live in `src/app/state/`:
- `menu.rs`: screen selection and menu flags.
- `dialogs.rs`: confirmation, create-world, and edit-world dialog data.
- `runtime.rs`: active `ClientSession`, snapshots, local prediction, and client log messages.
- `look.rs`: camera yaw/pitch and sensitivity.
- `backdrop.rs`: menu backdrop fade state.

The singleplayer worlds UI lives in `src/app/ui/worlds/`:
- `mod.rs`: screen shell and Escape handling.
- `table.rs`: worlds list layout and row actions.
- `dialogs/`: create/edit world modals and shared form helpers.
- `session.rs`: refresh world list and start singleplayer.

Starting singleplayer should only select/load a save and call `ClientSession::start_singleplayer`; the resulting runtime must behave like multiplayer after connection. Do not add UI-side gameplay branches that treat local worlds differently after the session starts.

Input systems:
- Enter/T opens chat.
- Escape toggles pause.
- In-game cursor capture drives mouse look.
- WASD, shift, and space feed predicted movement.

Scene rendering uses a first-person camera, generated floor/block geometry, and replicated player capsules.

Audio:
- `assets/main-screen/ambient-music.wav` loops across main-menu, worlds, and multiplayer menu screens.
- Main-menu ambience is managed by `main_menu_music_system` and fades out when the user loads into a world.
- Runtime audio should stay WAV unless there is a specific reason to add another decoder feature; earlier MP3/OGG experiments exposed decoder and seek reliability problems.

UI audio:
- Button click and hover sounds live at `assets/ui/button-click.wav` and `assets/ui/button-hover.wav`.
- `theme::game_button` and `theme::compact_button` record button sound requests while drawing egui widgets.
- Click sounds fire from `Response::clicked()`.
- Hover sounds fire only on hover entry, not every hovered frame.
- `button_sound_system` uses preloaded handles and spawns `PlaybackSettings::DESPAWN` one-shots, so rapid hover/click events can overlap without reusing a paused audio timeline.
- Keep hover SFX subtle and trimmed to the audible transient. Perceptual delay is very noticeable on hover, even when the scheduler is correct.
