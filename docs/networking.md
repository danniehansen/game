# Networking

Networking intentionally has one gameplay path with two bootstraps.

Shared runtime:
- `ClientSession` has one active variant: `ClientSession::Network(Box<LightyearGameSession>)`.
- Both local singleplayer and direct multiplayer send `ClientMessage` values over Lightyear channels.
- Both receive `ServerMessage` values from the same host wrapper and apply them through `ClientRuntime`.
- `GameServer` owns the authoritative domain state for auth, players, movement state acceptance, inventory, dropped items, chat, snapshots, and save tick state.

Singleplayer bootstrap:
- `ClientSession::start_singleplayer` loads a `WorldSave`, starts `spawn_loopback_server`, and connects the normal Lightyear client to the reserved loopback UDP address.
- The loopback host runs the same `run_host` code as a dedicated server, with `ServerSettings { auth_mode: Offline, singleplayer_host: Some(user.steam_id) }`.
- On shutdown, the client asks the local host for `world_save()` and persists it through `WorldStore`.

Multiplayer bootstrap:
- `./cli server --bind ... --auth ...` loads a world and calls `run_dedicated_server`, which delegates to the same `host::run_game_server`/`run_host` path.
- The multiplayer UI calls `ClientSession::connect(addr, user)` and uses the same client thread, message channels, runtime snapshots, prediction, chat, and inventory flow as singleplayer.
- On graceful terminal shutdown, the dedicated host returns its final `WorldSave`; `--world` saves back to that file, while the default dedicated world saves through `WorldStore`.

Networking files:
- `src/net/client.rs`: client session API, Lightyear client app, auth send, command queue, incoming message queue, and local-host shutdown/persistence hook.
- `src/net/host.rs`: loopback host spawn, dedicated host run, Lightyear server app, shutdown, and fixed server ticking.
- `src/net/host/handle.rs`: host command handle, final-save request, and thread shutdown.
- `src/net/host/routing.rs`: unauthenticated/authenticated message handling, connection maps, and envelope routing.
- `src/net/protocol.rs`: Lightyear channel setup and delivery selection for shared protocol messages.
- `src/net/dedicated/mod.rs`: CLI-facing dedicated server wrapper.

Do not reintroduce a direct in-process singleplayer transport or a singleplayer-only gameplay server. If a feature needs networking, add it to the shared protocol and `GameServer` flow so loopback singleplayer and remote multiplayer exercise the same code.

Steam mode is not production-ready. `AuthMode::Steam` currently rejects until a live SteamGameServer verifier is wired; the server browser path opens the Steam UI through the offline backend but does not register a visible server.
